homophone-ifier
=====================

Python 3 script that changes text you enter in such that every word that is a homophone is replaced with a random homophone.

For example: "How can I check if one string contains another substring in JavaScript?" becomes "How can aye check if won string contains another substring inn JavaScript?".

Homophones taken from: http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/homofone.htm
